Traditionally, it is his duty to bury them under a flat stone at the entrance of the family home. In urban areas today, they are buried in a location around the house that is unlikely to be polluted. When burying the umbilical cord, the father keeps his head turned away. This act symbolizes the continuation of the family lineage. In Malagasy culture, if a newborn’s umbilical cord is lost or improperly buried, they may grow up to be forgetful.'
